== Kappa Delta

## Summary

Sidebench Studios will design and build a fully responsively designed site for Kappa Delta. It will offer the public basic information regarding the KD fraternity (history, board members, active roster, etc.) as well as any news and upcoming events. The website will also allow for online donations to the fraternity.

Fraternity members who are logged into the site via a unique login will receive exclusive access to job/internship listings, be able to browse profiles of active members, and participate in online forum discussions.
